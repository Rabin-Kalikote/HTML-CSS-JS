        <p>Surya Secondary Boarding School was established in 1988 under the leadership of Mr. Narayan Shrestha who lives in Colorado, USA. Mr. Shrestha immigrated to the united states in 1977. When he returned, for the first time in 9 years, to his home village Khandbari, his heart swelled with the urge to establish quality education and health in Boarding school has evolved from 2-room rental site 900 students and 55 staff members. Here the criterion of excellence is applied to all the areas of life, and not just to academics. That is why our focus is on the person rather than on the syllabus to be covered curiosity and creativity are the traits we value in our students and in our school community as a whole.
        The Surya Secondary Boarding School started with 35 preschoolers and 2 teachers. The demand grew and one class/grade level was added every year through the donations sent (US$8,000 to $20,000 per year) by Mr. Shrestha. In order to pave a path for well-trained teachers, Mr. Shrestha created a scholarship fund to send Nepali teachers to the United States for one-year trainings. These trainings, since 2016, have been in the Montessori style of education fusing science and spirituality. More students, more teachers, and more land was added each year. Now, Surya Secondary Boarding School sits on 1800-acres with a one-of-a-kind and beautiful 8-building educational, housing and cafeteria facility. 900 students from pre-K (nursery) to grade 12 are served.
